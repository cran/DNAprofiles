DNAprofiles
===========

DNAprofiles is an R-package for studying forensic DNA profiling. In particular, it can be used to study the properties of familial database searching. The main feautures include sampling of DNA profiles/databases as well as relatives of profiles, database comparison exercises, likelihood ratio computations and there are/will be methods to efficiently evaluate the distribution of likelihood ratios. The package is currently work-in-progress and contributions are welcome.


The quickest way to get the development version of the package running locally is using devtools:
```R
require(devtools)
install_github(repo="MaartenKruijver/DNAprofiles")
require(DNAprofiles)
```
